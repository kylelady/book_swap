<h1>About Tau Beta Pi: MI-&Gamma;</h1>
<p> Tau Beta Pi (TBP) is the only engineering honor society representing the entire 
engineering profession.  It is the nation's second-oldest honor society, founded at 
Lehigh University in 1885 to mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred honor 
upon their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship and exemplary character as students 
in engineering, or by their attainments as alumni in the field of engineering, and to 
foster a spirit of liberal culture in engineering colleges.  </p>
<p>The Michigan-Gamma (MI-&Gamma; or MI-G) Chapter of TBP was founded in 1906 and is
currently the second largest chapter in TBP. In addition to the College of Engineering Book Swap, it
jointly runs the <a href="http://umcareerfair.org">SWE/TBP Career Fair</a> every fall with the Society of Women Engineers, hosts
the <a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/students/recognition/">College of Engineering Leaders and Honors Brunch</a> with the Epeians Leadership Honor Society,
and hosts numerous service events benefitting the college and community. For more information visit
