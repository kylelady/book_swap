<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>What is Book Swap?</h2>

<p>Every semester, Tau Beta Pi (The Engineering Honor Society) hosts the TBP Book Swap.
The Book Swap is open to all students. During the first two days of operation students will drop 
off books that they wish to be sold and will specify a price at which to sell them. On the third and fourth
days of operation, students may purchase books. About a week later, sellers may pick up checks and/or unsold books.
Sellers are given a check for the selling price of their sold books, less a 5% processing fee. If you have any questions,
please email <a href="mailto:tbp.bookswap@umich.edu">tbp.bookswap@umich.edu</a>.</p>

<h2>Is there anything I need to bring?</h2>
<p>For sellers, in addition to the books you'd like to sell, bring a completed seller's contract.
For buyers, bring a partially completed buyer contract (buyer information filled out). Contracts are available <a href="BookswapContracts.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Can I pay by credit card?</h2>
<p>Credit card payments <b>cannot</b> be accepted. Cash or checks (made out to "Tau Beta Pi") are the only accepted forms of payment</p>

<h2> I'm not in Engineering, can I still sell my books or buy books?</h2>
<p>Absolutely, the Book Swap is open to all Michigan students. Most sellers and buyers will be engineering students 
so the majority of the books being sold or sought will be for engineering or related courses.</p>

<h2>Can I sell books from non-engineering courses?</h2>
<p>Of course, if you're looking to sell it, we'll try to help you; however, as stated above, most buyers will be looking for
 engineering or related books, so if engineers don't tend to take the course, the book is less likely to sell.</p>
 
 <h2>Where is Book Swap?</h2>
 <p>Information on the location of Book Swap is available <a href="BookswapLocation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>This seems too good to be true, what's the catch?</h2>
<p><b>For buyers:</b> The price you see is the price you pay. All sales are final.<br/>
<b>For sellers:</b> Any unsold books are returned to you after the Book Swap. For any of your books that are sold, you receive
the money specified in the selling price, minus a 5% processing fee. All prices are fixed and must be in whole dollar amounts.
To ensure fairness for all sellers, we cannot provide information on prices for books previously received until book drop-off is closed.</p>

<h2>How do I get my money?</h2>
<p>If one or more of your books sells, you will be issued a check which can be picked up during the hours for picking up money or unsold books.</p>
