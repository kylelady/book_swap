<h1>About Bookswap</h1>
<p>Every semester, Tau Beta Pi (The Engineering Honor Society) hosts the Engineering Bookswap.
The Bookswap is open to all students. During the first two days of operation students will drop 
off books that they wish to be sold and will specify a price at which to sell them. On the third and fourth
days of operation, students may purchase books. About a week later, sellers may pick up checks and/or unsold books.
Sellers are given a check for the selling price of their sold books, less a 5% processing fee. If you have any questions,
please email <a href="mailto:bookswapf12@umich.edu">bookswapf12@umich.edu</a>.</p>
